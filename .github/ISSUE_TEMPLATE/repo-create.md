Please prove you have followed the appropriate approval process for this new
repo by including links to the relevant approvals (meeting minutes, e-mail
thread, etc.)

Authoritative requirements are here: https://git.k8s.io/community/github-management/kubernetes-repositories.md

tl;dr (but really you should read the linked doc, this may be stale)
- If this is a core repository, then sig-architecture must approve
- If this is a SIG repository, then this must follow the procedure spelled out
  in that SIG's charter
